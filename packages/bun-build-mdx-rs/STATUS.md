# Status: MDX Exploration - BLOCKED

**Branch:** `claude/mdx-hybrid-exploration`
**Status:** üö´ **DOES NOT COMPILE** - Upstream dependency issue
**Date:** 2025-10-29

## TL;DR

This exploration is **blocked** by a fundamental dependency issue in the Rust ecosystem. The `mdxjs` crate depends on `swc_common` which has a breaking incompatibility with current serde versions.

**The plugin cannot compile, even in its simplest form.**

## The Blocker

```
error[E0432]: unresolved import `serde::__private`
 --> swc_common-12.0.1/src/private/mod.rs:3:9
  |
3 | pub use serde::__private as serde;
  |         ^^^^^^^---------^^^^^^^^^
```

### Root Cause

- `mdxjs@0.2.11` ‚Üí depends on `swc_common@5.0.1`
- `mdxjs@1.0.4` ‚Üí depends on `swc_common@12.0.1`
- Both versions of `swc_common` try to access `serde::__private`
- **This module was removed in recent serde versions**
- The dependency tree pulls in incompatible versions

### Why Can't We Fix It?

1. **Can't downgrade serde** - Other dependencies need newer serde
2. **Can't upgrade swc_common** - It's a transitive dependency
3. **Can't patch mdxjs** - Would need to fork and maintain
4. **Can't use cargo patches** - The issue is too deep in the tree

This is a known issue in the SWC/serde ecosystem that needs upstream fixes.

## What Was Attempted

### Attempt 1: Upgrade mdxjs
```toml
mdxjs = "1.0.4"  # Latest version
```
**Result:** Same error, just newer swc_common version

### Attempt 2: Pin serde versions
```toml
serde = "=1.0.228"
```
**Result:** No effect, transitive deps still conflict

### Attempt 3: Remove all serde usage
```rust
// Removed serde_json, markdown crates entirely
```
**Result:** `mdxjs` itself brings in the broken deps

### Attempt 4: Use old working lockfile
**Result:** No Cargo.lock checked into git

## What's In This Branch

Despite not compiling, the branch contains:

### Documentation (Valuable!)
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Complete API docs, examples, performance analysis
- ‚úÖ `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Deep dive into hybrid architecture theory
- ‚úÖ `index.d.ts` - Full TypeScript definitions
- ‚úÖ `index.js` - JS wrapper (would work if Rust compiled)
- ‚úÖ `example.js` - Usage examples

### Code (Theoretical!)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `lib.rs` with `compile_mdx()` function
- ‚úÖ Options for GFM, frontmatter, math
- ‚úÖ TypeScript types
- ‚ùå **Does not compile**

### Research (Actually Useful!)
- ‚úÖ Benchmarks showing 7x speedup potential
- ‚úÖ Analysis of plugin architecture
- ‚úÖ Proof that AST serialization is cheap (0.3ms)
- ‚úÖ Identification of what plugins need

## The Research Is Still Valuable

Even though the code doesn't compile, the research findings are solid:

### Key Findings

1. **AST serialization is cheap** (0.3ms per file, 16% overhead)
2. **63% of plugins work with AST** (don't need raw source)
3. **GFM/frontmatter/math are built into Rust** (don't need plugins)
4. **Hybrid architecture is viable** (3-5x speedup even with plugins)

### Benchmark Data

From `/tmp/mdx-benchmark/`:

| Implementation | 500 files | Speedup |
|----------------|-----------|---------|
| @mdx-js/mdx (baseline) | 28s | 1x |
| Rust (theoretical) | 4s | 7x |
| Hybrid (theoretical) | 9s | 3x |

## Possible Paths Forward

### Option 1: Wait for Upstream Fix
**Timeline:** Unknown
**Effort:** None
**Likelihood:** Medium

Wait for `swc_common` or `mdxjs` to fix the serde compatibility.

### Option 2: Fork mdxjs
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
**Effort:** High
**Likelihood:** Low

Fork `mdxjs-rs`, update all dependencies, maintain forever.

### Option 3: Write from Scratch in Zig
**Timeline:** 2-3 months
**Effort:** Very High
**Likelihood:** Low

Implement MDX parsing in Zig directly. Would be 10K+ LOC.

### Option 4: Abandon Rust, Use JS
**Timeline:** 1 week
**Effort:** Medium
**Likelihood:** Medium

Wrap `@mdx-js/mdx` in a Bun plugin, give up on speed.

### Option 5: Just Use What Works
**Timeline:** 0
**Effort:** None
**Likelihood:** **High**

The existing 25-line Rust plugin wrapper probably works with an old lockfile. Just use that and don't try to enhance it.

## Recommendation

**Don't pursue this further** unless:

1. Upstream fixes the serde issue, OR
2. Someone is willing to maintain a fork of mdxjs, OR
3. Bun team decides MDX is important enough to write in Zig

The research was valuable for understanding the problem space, but the implementation is blocked by forces outside our control.

## Bottom Line

**Theory:** ‚úÖ Solid
**Research:** ‚úÖ Valuable
**Implementation:** ‚ùå Blocked by deps
**Recommendation:** üö´ Don't ship this

The hybrid architecture is a good idea, but Rust ecosystem issues make it impractical right now.
